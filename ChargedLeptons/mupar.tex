%Precision measurements of muon decay spectrum

Improved measurements of muon decay parameters have potential to probe new physics.  While some terms of the effective Lagrangian of muon decay are tightly bound by the neutrino mass scale if naturalness is assumed for both Dirac~\cite{erwin:2006}

and Majorana~\cite{erwin:2007}

neutrinos, 6 out of 10 effective couplings are not constrained by these considerations, and their best limits come from experiments.

Moreover, $g^{S}_{RL}$ and $g^{S}_{RL}$ are only constrained for Majorana neutrinos.  If a deviation from the Standard model is found, and if it is possible to establish that it is due to one of those couplings, it would suggest that neutrinos are Dirac particles.  This is a unique probe, as other known experiments positively test for the Majorana nature of neutrinos.
